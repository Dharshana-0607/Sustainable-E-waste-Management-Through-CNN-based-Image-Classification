# Sustainable-E-waste-Management-Through-CNN-based-Image-Classification
This project uses a CNN-based deep learning model with transfer learning to automatically classify electronic waste from images. It supports efficient e-waste segregation, reduces manual effort, and promotes sustainable recycling through intelligent, image-based waste management.

* Overview
The rapid growth of electronic devices has led to a significant increase in electronic waste (e-waste), posing serious environmental and health risks. Proper segregation and recycling of e-waste are essential for sustainable development. This project proposes an image-based deep learning solution to automatically classify electronic waste using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), reducing manual effort and improving recycling efficiency.

* Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system that can accurately classify different categories of e-waste from images. By automating the classification process, the system supports sustainable waste management practices and helps minimize environmental impact.

* Methodology
The proposed system follows a deep learning workflow consisting of dataset collection, image preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
A CNN-based transfer learning approach is used, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on an e-waste image dataset. Transfer learning helps improve classification accuracy while reducing training time and computational cost. Input images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model robustness. The trained model predicts the category of e-waste based on visual features extracted from the images.
 Dataset and Results
The dataset consists of labeled images representing common electronic waste items such as circuit boards, batteries, cables, and electronic components. The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. Training and validation curves demonstrate effective learning and generalization. The results indicate that the proposed approach can reliably classify e-waste images, making it suitable for real-world applications.
